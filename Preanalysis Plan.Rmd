# Introduction

In this project, we attempt to analyze various procedures for preserving the freshness of cilantro. Namely, we will attempt to measure if the following have any effect:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Keeping cilantro in the fridge versus outside
  \item Keeping cilantro in a plastic bag versus not
  \item For refrigerated cilantro, keeping cilantro close to the cooling source at the top of the fridge versus farther away.
\end{itemize}

We hypothesize that cilantro kept in a fridge in a bag and far away from the cooling source will remain fresh for longer.

# Methodology

## Experimental setup

For convience and budgetary concerns, we decided to use a group ate's mini-fridge to study the effect

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\\
\textbf{Shelf 1 (Top)} \\
\textit{Closest to cooling source} \\
\\
\hline
\\
\textbf{Shelf 2} \\
\\
\\
\hline
\\
\textbf{Shelf 3} \\
\textit{Farthest from cooling source} \\
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\textit{Mini-Fridge layout}

## Randomization Scheme

From our 40 cilantro stalks, we assigned a group of 5 cilantro stalks to one of eight treatment groups at random. The treatment plans for each of the eight groups is as follows:

| Group | Location | Bagged |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Outside the fridge | No |
| 2 | Outside the fridge | Yes |
| 3 | Fridge shelf 1 | No |
| 4 | Fridge shelf 1 | Yes |
| 5 | Fridge shelf 2 | No |
| 6 | Fridge shelf 2 | Yes |
| 7 | Fridge shelf 3 | No |
| 8 | Fridge shelf 3 | Yes |



# Testing Procedure


Things to test:

1. Fridge layer versus each other

- Compute mean of differences and compare
- Compute F statistic, permutation test on F statistic for the three levels
  - Sensitive to outliers

Possible issue: when we weigh cilantros collectively, we can't really apply a permutation test.
So do we continue to use weight as a metric?

If no significance found, pool the fridge samples

2. Fridge versus outside

3. Out of bag vs in-bag
  -If Test 1 was significant, there is some necessary stratification.
  
Should pre-analysis plan specify response to common issues? (i.e. If my data has a long tail, should I pre-specify that I plan to use medians. A: yes)

More versatile possiblity: using ranks, which works with F statistics.
