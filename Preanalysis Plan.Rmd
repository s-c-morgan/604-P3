# Introduction

## Experiment setups:

* 40 Sprigs of cilantro, brought at once from Target, randomized and put into 8 sets, 5 sprigs per set.
* Each set is either stored outside the mini-fridge, or in layer 1, 2, 3 of the fridge; and is either stored in a ziplock bag or not.
* The weight of each set of sprig is measured in grams daily (thus, 8 measurements per day).
* One image of each set is taken daily under as simmilar lighting conditions as possible. From the image we obtain metrics such as saturation, color, wiltedness score, texture score

## Goal

To study the effects of putting in ziplock bags and putting in a fridge on preserving cilantro's freshness

# Methodology

## Randomization Scheme

* Permutation test on whether different layers of the fridge (which presumably has different temperature mosture) has an effect on preserving freshness
potentially pulling data from different layers together after this test.

* Permutation test on whether putting in a ziplock bags has an effect toward freshness: test between 30 sprigs in the fridge.
Use conditioning if data from 3 layers differ and could not be pulled together.

* Permutation test on whether in fridge and out of fridge sprigs differ in freshness. E.g. normal permutation test between 20 out-of-ziplock-bag sprigs.

## Model based Scheme

* ANOVA: use an F test to test significant differences in means between different layers of the fridge.

* Fits linear model (e.g. weight) as a function of time, use the slope as an indicator of weight loss speed

# Preliminary Results

* Conclusion on whether putting cilantro sprigs in different layers affect freshness
* Conclusion on whether putting cilantro sprigs in the fridge helps perserving freshness
* Conclusion on whether putting cilantro sprigs in ziplocks helps perserving freshness
